We are looking to produce a proof of concept, demonstrating three Google API technologies. Audio --> Text; Text --> Translation and Image --> recognition.

I would prefer PHP and ideally Laravel to be used as the base framework, using the standard user authentication modules. Design doesn't have to be beautiful, just clean (bootstrap).

Step 1 & 2 are preferably in the same web system but different modules/menus. It could be merged to one list; depends what is easiest.

Step 1:
- Main web page listing all video and audio files
-- Upload a new file
-- Search option to search text (grep of text files) transcribed and translated by Google
-- Grid of historical uploaded files (files stored on webserver [GUID - unique name], translations stored in file [json] with same name as image with same name) 
--- Date/time uploaded
--- Title
--- Description
--- Link to play the video/audio file
--- Tags
--- Button to submit to Google for transcribing (ideally with word timing; or if possible paragraph timing 0:00-00:15: "blah blah blah", 0:16-0:20: "blah bla".)
--- Button to submit to Google to translate from original Transcribe into selected language.

Step 2:
- Main web page listing all images uploaded
-- Upload a new image
-- Search option to search text tags added by Google or users
-- Grid of historical uploaded files (files stored on webserver [GUID - unique name], tags stored in file [json] which has same name as image.
--- Date/time uploaded
--- Title
--- Description
--- Thumbnail - link to larger file
--- Tags
--- Button to submit to Google for auto tagging [variable to set tolerance of tags used > 99%]
--- Button to add user defined tags.
